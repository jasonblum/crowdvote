"""
Comprehensive test suite for Alphabet Delegation Test community validation.

This test suite validates the complex delegation inheritance calculations using
the systematic alphabet test community (AAAAAAAAAAA through LLLLLLLLLLL).
It ensures that fractional star averaging, tag-specific inheritance, and
multi-level delegation chains work correctly in realistic scenarios.

The tests use the same community data that can be viewed in the UI, providing
both visual validation and mathematical verification of CrowdVote's core
delegation algorithms.
