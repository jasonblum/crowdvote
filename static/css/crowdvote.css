/*
 * CrowdVote Site-wide Styles
 * 
 * This file contains common styles used across all pages of the CrowdVote application.
 * It should be loaded after Tailwind CSS but before page-specific CSS files.
 * 
 * TODO: In a future change, consolidate repetitive CSS from templates into this file.
 * Look for common patterns in:
 * - Panel/card styles (bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg shadow-sm, etc.)
 * - Button styles (primary, secondary, danger, etc.)
 * - Typography (headings, body text, etc.)
 * - Dark mode utilities
 * - Layout helpers (spacing, containers, etc.)
 * - Form elements (inputs, selects, etc.)
 * - Status badges (active, closed, draft, etc.)
 * 
 * This consolidation will reduce template bloat and ensure consistent styling
 * across the entire application.
