# CrowdVote Slogans

Think globally<br>...follow locally!

Real Democracy happens **BETWEEN** elections!

Why can't we represent each other?

Democracy<br/>...we've been doing it wrong.

Your term is up when I say it's up!

Artisan, locally-crafted, free-range, small-batch representation!

Democracy *democratized*

Power to the People!

Representative Democracy *isn't*.

Let's *Democracy* Together!

100% Turnout out of the box!

I can represent my own &#^! self, thank you very much!

Liberté, égalité, fraternité!

Two Words! Hanging Chads!

I'm a citizen.<br/>...and I vote!

Government of the people by the people for the people!

CrowdVote<br/>Democratizing Democracy since 2025.

Put the lame duck down.

Pack the Court<br/>...with all of us!

Nullify gerrymandering!

Free politics!

Astroturf is tacky!

"*Representation*" is the problem.

~~K Street~~<br/>Main Street!
