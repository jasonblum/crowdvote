Speechbubble giving definition and usage of the term 'crowdvote': crowd•vote /ˈkraʊdvəʊt/ ▸ v. To crowdsource decisions to an instant runoff between members of a community, who are then free to crowdsource their votes on to each other, whenever, and on whichever issues they like -- thereby effecting within their community, a free marketplace in which members can compete to represent others' interests, socially and unregulated by traditional electoral processes and cycles: 'The candidate pledged to crowdvote every official decision to her constituents.' ⎻ORIGIN 2007 http://CrowdVote.com (CC BY-SA 4.0)

For several years now, I’ve been daydreaming about building a free and Open Source web application to help people make decisions together. And I have two questions for you:

    Could you use this?
    What would you change?

I call it “CrowdVote”, and it brings a process I’ve been calling Social Democracy (as in “Social Media” …not the political ideology) to local communities such as condo associations, town councils, student governments, and anywhere else you might want to “crowdsource” decisions to a community of people.

Unlike a conventional, web-based polling application however, CrowdVote allows community members to then delegate their votes on to an Instant Runoff between one or more other members whose judgement they trust, whenever - and, specifically, on whichever issues they like.

This is done through tagging the decisions you are voting on with terms like “budget” or “environment”, which allows other members of the community who trust your judgement on such issues, to then follow you (inherit your votes) on those tags.

Because votes (and their tags) are transitive, the people from whom you inherit your votes may be inheriting theirs from someone else, and they from someone else, and so on.

Trees of influence can emerge organically and evolve to more accurately reflect community sentiment in real time, rather than only once every election cycle.

    …because Real Democracy happens between elections. 

A concrete example: say a condo board will decide next Tuesday what color to paint the community room.

Mary is a board member, and wants to crowdsource her decision on CrowdVote, along with any specific color choices, whether or not folks can write in their own colors, supporting documentation like color codes/swatches, contractor proposals, etc…

Her neighbor Jack sees Mary’s published question, and responds by casting a Ranked Choice ballot: [ ‘Cathedral Gray’, ‘Aqua Chiffon’, ‘Oceanside’ ].  And if Jack wants to encourage other members of the community to follow him (again, to inherit his ballot) …he’ll want to take a moment to further tag Mary’s decision with terms he feels characterize her question and, more importantly, on which others in the community can follow him: [ “maintenance”, “beautification”, “community room” ].

Now, if their neighbor Sophia is out of town or fails to cast a ballot before next Tuesday for whatever reason, CrowdVote can attempt to calculate a ballot on her behalf …but only if she has previously identified in her profile other community members whose judgement she trusts sufficiently to follow their positions on decisions like this one.  Moreover, she may be inheriting votes from lots of people, on a variety of matters.  She may follow Mary on “environmental” issues, Jack on “maintenance” and “budget,” and also Susan on “budget”. …CrowdVote just figures out who’s following whom, on which issues, and runs them all through an Instant Runoff to come up with Sophia’s ballot, which she is of course free to override anytime before Tuesday by logging in to CrowdVote and casting her own.

    CrowdVote = Free Market Representation. 

…Rather than tying Representation to a fixed term in office, CrowdVote does something not unlike what Social Media has done to traditional media: it gives everyone a voice, even if it’s only a re-tweet, +1, Pin or a Like, …all of which are functionally analogous, in the CrowdVote marketplace, to inheriting a vote.

People seeking to expand their influence in the community, like Jack above, will compete for followers by voting and tagging decisions thoughtfully, perhaps in conjunction with blogging and tweeting or otherwise promoting a reputation for expertise in the issues they care about.  Lobbyists will turn their attention to those members with the most followers at any given time.  Nobody has to wait until the next election to be heard.  And all of this happens right out of the gate, because when you first fire CrowdVote up and begin publishing decisions to be voted on, your constituents will all effectively default to inheriting your vote, leaving you in a position of voting in accordance with the wishes of people who are all just inheriting your vote…but who are all free now to cast their own vote, or to follow someone else.  They’re not stuck with you until the next election!

Now, CrowdVote won’t be able to enforce being used in any particular way.  If you run for office on the pledge to CrowdVote all your decisions and then neglect to do so, or if your community decides to use CrowdVote itself in lieu of electing representatives at all, CrowdVote has no way to follow up on what happens after a decision’s voting period closes.  What CrowdVote can do, however, is make all data completely transparent and easily queried and audited through a friendly REST-ful API.  Anyone can re-run the numbers anytime they like.  And the calculation and tallying of every ballot is easily delineated in verbose tally reports.  Finally, CrowdVote also provides a mechanism to verify everyone’s membership in the community, while preserving the anonymity of the relationship between their identity and their voting record, thereby allowing voters to remain anonymous, if they like.

I don’t want to abuse your time any further, so just a few quick tags to further characterize the project, in case anyone out there might like to get involved: Social Democracy (as in “Social Media”), Instant Runoff Voting (aka Ranked Choice Voting) as opposed to First-Past-the-Post, folksonomy, Python, Django, Open Source,  Creative Commons, REST, JQuery and Twitter Bootstrap.

    Could you use CrowdVote in your community?
    What would you change?

…I really appreciate any feedback or words of encouragement at jason@CrowdVote.com, @CrowdVote or Facebook/CrowdVote!  Beyond just being Open Sourced, I’d love to see this built such that any non-technical community leader could just deploy their own instance to the cloud with a simple click of a button.  For now, I’m slowly building this thing between work and family, but figured I oughta get the idea out there and protected for everyone under:
