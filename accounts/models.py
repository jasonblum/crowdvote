    - Followee: The user who receives the delegated voting power

    The following relationship creates a delegation chain where:
    1. If a follower doesn't vote directly, their vote is calculated based on
       their followees' votes
    2. Multiple levels of delegation are supported (A follows B, B follows C)
    3. Circular references are prevented in the calculation algorithm
    4. Users can always override delegation by voting directly
