# Change 0009: Complete Snapshot Calculation Engine

## Description

Plan #8 implemented the snapshot infrastructure (model, signals, UI templates) but left the core calculation engine incomplete. The `SnapshotBasedStageBallots` service currently only **counts existing ballots** from the snapshot rather than **calculating new ballots** from delegation relationships. The `CreateCalculationSnapshot` service captures raw data (memberships, followings, ballots) but doesn't capture the **delegation tree structure** (inheritance chains, calculation paths) needed for the `vote-inheritance-tree.html` visualization. This plan completes the calculation engine.

## What Plan #8 Claimed But Didn't Deliver

From CHANGELOG commit 4412ac4:
- ✅ **CLAIMED**: "Completed `SnapshotBasedStageBallots` to process from frozen snapshot data"
- ❌ **REALITY**: `_process_snapshot_ballots()` (lines 905-999 in `democracy/services.py`) only counts statistics from existing ballots. It doesn't calculate ballots, build delegation trees, or create Vote objects.

- ✅ **CLAIMED**: "Immutable system snapshots capturing complete delegation trees"
- ❌ **REALITY**: `CreateCalculationSnapshot._capture_system_state()` (lines 756-841) captures raw data only (memberships, followings, ballots). No delegation tree structure, no inheritance chains, no calculation paths.

- ✅ **CLAIMED**: "Created `snapshot_detail.html` template with delegation tree visualization (modeled after `vote-inheritance-tree.html`)"
- ❌ **REALITY**: Template exists but has no data to display. The `delegation_tree` in snapshot_data is empty or minimal.

## Current Problems

### Problem 1: `SnapshotBasedStageBallots` Doesn't Calculate Ballots

**File**: `democracy/services.py` (lines 844-999)

Current `_process_snapshot_ballots()` implementation:
```python
# Lines 947-989: Only counts existing ballots
if member_id_str in snapshot_data['existing_ballots']:
    ballot_data = snapshot_data['existing_ballots'][member_id_str]
    if not ballot_data['is_calculated']:
        stats['manual_ballots'] += 1
    else:
        stats['calculated_ballots'] += 1
else:
    stats['no_ballot'] += 1
```

**Missing functionality**:
- No recursive ballot calculation for calculated voters
- No delegation chain traversal
- No tag matching logic
- No Vote object creation
- No ballot averaging across multiple sources
- No circular reference prevention tracking
- No delegation depth tracking

**What it should do**:
- For each member without a ballot, recursively calculate from followings
- Build complete delegation tree with inheritance chains
- Track calculation paths for audit trail
- Store all tree data in `snapshot.snapshot_data['delegation_tree']`

### Problem 2: `CreateCalculationSnapshot` Doesn't Capture Delegation Tree

**File**: `democracy/services.py` (lines 689-842)

Current `_capture_system_state()` returns (lines 830-841):
```python
return {
    'metadata': {...},
    'community_memberships': [list of user IDs],
    'followings': {follower_id: [{followee_id, tags, order}]},
    'existing_ballots': {voter_id: {ballot data}},
    'decision_data': {...},
    'choices_data': [...]
}
```

**Missing**:
- No `delegation_tree` structure
- No inheritance chains showing X→Y→Z paths
- No calculation details (how ballots were averaged)
- No influence counts (who inherited from whom)
- No circular reference tracking

**What it should include**:
```python
'delegation_tree': {
    'nodes': [
        {
            'voter_id': 'uuid',
            'username': 'Alice',

                    'order': 2,
                    'is_anonymous': False
                }
            ]
        }
    ],

        {
            'follower': 'Bob_id',
            'followee': 'Alice_id',
            'tags': ['budget'],
            'order': 1,
            'active_for_decision': True  # Tag match occurred
        }
    ],
    'inheritance_chains': [
        {
            'final_voter': 'Bob',
            'final_voter_id': 'uuid',
            'choice': 'choice_uuid',
            'choice_title': 'Option A',
            'final_stars': 4.5,
            'calculation_path': [
                {'voter': 'Alice', 'stars': 5.0, 'weight': 0.5, 'tags': ['budget']},
                {'voter': 'Carol', 'stars': 4.0, 'weight': 0.5, 'tags': ['budget']}
            ]
        }
    ],
    'circular_prevented': [
        {'voter': 'David', 'attempted_path': 'David→Eve→Frank→David'}
    ]
}
```

### Problem 3: Old `/results/` View Still Active (Leftover from Pre-Plan #8)

**File**: `democracy/views.py` (line ~500+)

The old `decision_results()` view is still active and uses pre-Plan #8 logic. When user visits `/communities/<uuid>/decisions/<uuid>/results/`, they see:
- Manual votes only (no calculated votes)
- Wrong statistics (0 direct votes, 0 calculated votes)
- "Complete vote Tally" section that doesn't match reality

**What should happen**:
- **Remove entirely** - There should be NO separate `/results/` page
- The correct flow is: Decision detail page → Historical Results table → "View Details" → Snapshot detail page
- Snapshot detail page shows: Decision header → Delegation tree → STAR tally

### Problem 4: `snapshot_detail.html` Missing Visualization Data

**File**: `democracy/templates/democracy/snapshot_detail.html`

Template exists (Phase 7 of Plan #8) but displays empty/minimal data because:
- `delegation_tree` in snapshot is empty
- No inheritance chains to display
- No calculation paths to show
- Doesn't match `vote-inheritance-tree.html` visualization

**What it needs**:
- Section 1: Manual Ballots (with influence counts)
- Section 2: Calculated Ballots (with inheritance chains, indented tree structure, tag matching)
- Section 3: No Ballot Calculated (with reasons)
- Section 4: STAR Voting Tally (already exists)
- Use similar styling to `crowdvote/templates/vote-inheritance-tree.html` (dark theme, monospace, color coding)

## Files That Need Changes

### Phase 1: Complete `SnapshotBasedStageBallots` Calculation Engine

**File**: `democracy/services.py` (lines 844-999)

**Current `SnapshotBasedStageBallots` class**:
- `__init__()` - OK
- `process()` - OK (calls `_process_snapshot_ballots`)
- `_process_snapshot_ballots()` - **NEEDS COMPLETE REWRITE**

**New method needed**:
- `_calculate_ballot_from_snapshot()` - Recursive method (similar to `StageBallots.get_or_calculate_ballot()` but snapshot-only)

**Algorithm for `_calculate_ballot_from_snapshot(voter_id, snapshot_data, follow_path=[], delegation_depth=0)`**:

1. **Circular detection**: If `voter_id` in `follow_path`, return `None` and log circular reference
2. **Check for existing manual ballot**: If in `snapshot_data['existing_ballots']` and `is_calculated=False`, return that ballot
3. **Get followings**: From `snapshot_data['followings'][voter_id]`
4. **If no followings**: Return `None` (can't calculate)
5. **For each following relationship**:
   - **RECURSE**: Call `_calculate_ballot_from_snapshot(followee_id, ..., follow_path + [voter_id], delegation_depth + 1)`
   - Get followee's ballot and tags
   - **Tag matching**: Check if `following['tags']` match `followee_ballot['tags']`
   - If match: Add to `ballots_to_average` list
   - Track in delegation tree data structure
6. **Average all matching ballots**: Simple averaging (not STAR voting)
7. **Build delegation tree node** with all calculation details
8. **Return calculated ballot** with inherited tags

**Key difference from `StageBallots.get_or_calculate_ballot()`**:
- NO database queries (works entirely from `snapshot_data` dict)
- Builds delegation tree structure as it goes
- Stores everything in `snapshot.snapshot_data['delegation_tree']` for audit

### Phase 2: Enhance `CreateCalculationSnapshot` to Build Delegation Tree

**File**: `democracy/services.py` (lines 689-842)

**Current `_capture_system_state()` method**:
- Returns raw data only
- No delegation tree

**Changes needed**:

1. After capturing raw data (lines 766-841), add:
```python
# Build delegation tree by running calculation
delegation_tree = self._build_delegation_tree(snapshot_data)
snapshot_data['delegation_tree'] = delegation_tree
```

2. **New method**: `_build_delegation_tree(snapshot_data)`
   - For each member in `community_memberships`:
     - Check if they have manual ballot → add to `nodes` as 'manual'
     - If no ballot, calculate using snapshot-only logic
     - Track all inheritance chains
     - Count influences (who inherited from whom)
   - Return complete delegation tree structure

**OR** (simpler approach):

Make `CreateCalculationSnapshot.process()` call `SnapshotBasedStageBallots.process()` immediately after snapshot creation, which:
1. Calculates all ballots from snapshot data
2. Builds delegation tree
3. Stores everything in `snapshot.snapshot_data['delegation_tree']`

This way the snapshot is created → immediately processed → contains complete tree.

### Phase 3: Remove Old `/results/` View (Leftover from Pre-Plan #8)

**Files**: `democracy/views.py` and `democracy/urls.py`

**What to do**: Delete entirely (no redirect needed)

1. **Delete `decision_results()` view** from `democracy/views.py`
2. **Remove URL pattern** from `democracy/urls.py`:
   ```python
   # REMOVE THIS LINE:
   path('communities/<uuid:community_id>/decisions/<uuid>/results/', 
        views.decision_results, name='decision_results'),
   ```
3. **Search for any links** pointing to `decision_results` URL name and update them:
   - `{% url 'democracy:decision_results' %}` → Remove or point to decision detail page
   - Check templates, forms, and views for references

**Why**: The correct flow is Decision detail → Historical Results table → Snapshot detail. There should be no separate `/results/` page.

### Phase 4: Enhance `snapshot_detail.html` Template

**File**: `democracy/templates/democracy/snapshot_detail.html`

**Changes needed**:

1. **Manual Ballots Section** (lines ~140-170):
   - Display each manual voter
   - Show their ballot (choice → stars mapping)
   - Show their tags
   - Show influence count: `(N)` where N = # of people who inherited from this voter
   - Highlight most influential voter(s) with 🏆

2. **Calculated Ballots Section** (lines ~180-280):
   - Use **indented tree structure** like `vote-inheritance-tree.html`
   - For each calculated voter:
     - Show username (or "Anonymous")
     - Show who they follow (with tags)
     - Show tag matching results (✓ MATCH or ✗ NO MATCH)
     - Show inherited ballots and averaging
     - Show final calculated ballot
     - Use color coding: 🟢 manual voters, 🔵 calculated voters
     - Use indentation to show delegation depth

3. **No Ballot Section** (lines ~290-330):
   - List voters with no ballot
   - Show reason: "Not following anyone" or "Following others but no tag matches"

4. **Styling**: Match `vote-inheritance-tree.html` aesthetic
   - Dark background with light text
   - Monospace font for tree structure
   - Color-coded badges for voter types
   - Indented structure for hierarchy

**Reference**: `crowdvote/templates/vote-inheritance-tree.html` (lines 1-572) for:
- Styling patterns (lines 8-163)
- Tree structure rendering (lines 106-114)
- Color schemes (lines 124-156)

### Phase 5: Update `snapshot_detail` View to Pass Tree Data

**File**: `democracy/views.py` (line ~900+)

**Current `snapshot_detail()` view**:
- Extracts some delegation tree data
- Calculates influence counts
- Passes to template

**Changes needed**:
- Ensure `delegation_tree` from `snapshot.snapshot_data` is fully extracted
- Organize nodes into manual/calculated/no-ballot categories
- Sort by delegation depth for proper rendering
- Pass `user_lookup` dict mapping user IDs to User objects (for display names)

## Testing Requirements

### New Test File: `tests/test_services/test_snapshot_calculation_complete.py`

Test scenarios:
1. **Single-level delegation**: A follows B → verify B's ballot calculated correctly
2. **Multi-level delegation**: D → C → B → A (4 levels) → verify all ballots
3. **Tag matching**: A votes with ["budget"], B follows A on ["budget"], C follows A on ["environment"] → B inherits, C doesn't
4. **Multiple sources**: E follows both A and B on ["budget"] → E's ballot is average of A+B
5. **Circular prevention**: F → G → H → F → verify circular reference logged, no infinite loop
6. **Snapshot isolation**: Change followings after snapshot → verify snapshot results unchanged
7. **Delegation tree structure**: Verify `delegation_tree` in snapshot contains all expected fields
8. **Influence counts**: Verify most influential voter identified correctly

### Update Existing Tests

**File**: `tests/test_services/test_snapshot_isolation.py`
- Update assertions to expect full delegation tree in snapshot_data
- Verify `delegation_tree['nodes']`, `delegation_tree['edges']`, `delegation_tree['inheritance_chains']` populated

**File**: `tests/test_views/test_decision_results_view.py` (if it exists)
- Update to test redirect behavior (if keeping view as redirect)
- Or remove tests entirely (if deleting view)

## Algorithm: Complete Ballot Calculation from Snapshot

This is the core algorithm for `SnapshotBasedStageBallots._calculate_ballot_from_snapshot()`:

```
FUNCTION calculate_ballot_from_snapshot(voter_id, snapshot_data, follow_path, delegation_depth):
    
    # 1. Circular reference detection
    IF voter_id IN follow_path:
        LOG circular reference
        RECORD in delegation_tree['circular_prevented']
        RETURN None
    
    # 2. Check for existing manual ballot
    IF voter_id IN snapshot_data['existing_ballots']:
        ballot = snapshot_data['existing_ballots'][voter_id]
        IF ballot['is_calculated'] == False:
            # Manual ballot found
            ADD to delegation_tree['nodes'] as 'manual' type
            RETURN ballot
    
    # 3. Get following relationships
    followings = snapshot_data['followings'].get(voter_id, [])
    IF followings is empty:
        # Can't calculate - not following anyone
        ADD to delegation_tree['nodes'] as 'no_ballot' type
        RETURN None
    
    # 4. Collect ballots to average
    ballots_to_average = []
    inherited_tags = SET()
    
    FOR EACH following IN followings:
        followee_id = following['followee_id']
        follow_tags = following['tags']
        
        # RECURSE to get followee's ballot
        followee_ballot = calculate_ballot_from_snapshot(
            followee_id, 
            snapshot_data, 
            follow_path + [voter_id],
            delegation_depth + 1
        )
        
        IF followee_ballot is None:
            CONTINUE  # Skip this following
        
        # 5. Tag matching
        followee_tags = followee_ballot['tags']
        should_inherit = FALSE
        matching_tags = []
        
        IF follow_tags is empty:  # "ALL" tags
            should_inherit = TRUE
            matching_tags = followee_tags
        ELSE:
            # Check intersection
            matching_tags = INTERSECTION(follow_tags, followee_tags)
            IF matching_tags is not empty:
                should_inherit = TRUE
        
        # 6. Record in delegation tree
        ADD edge to delegation_tree['edges'] with:
            follower: voter_id
            followee: followee_id
            tags: follow_tags
            active_for_decision: should_inherit
        
        IF should_inherit:
            # Add ballot to averaging list
            ballots_to_average.APPEND(followee_ballot)
            inherited_tags.ADD(matching_tags)
            
            # Record inheritance chain
            ADD to delegation_tree['inheritance_chains'] showing:
                final_voter: voter_id
                source: followee_id
                calculation_path: detailed breakdown
    
    # 7. Average ballots (simple averaging, not STAR voting)
    IF ballots_to_average is empty:
        ADD to delegation_tree['nodes'] as 'no_ballot' type
        RETURN None
    
    calculated_ballot = {}
    FOR EACH choice:
        total_stars = SUM of stars from all ballots_to_average
        avg_stars = total_stars / COUNT(ballots_to_average)
        calculated_ballot[choice] = avg_stars
    
    # 8. Add to delegation tree
    ADD to delegation_tree['nodes'] as 'calculated' type with:
        voter_id: voter_id
        votes: calculated_ballot
        tags: LIST(inherited_tags)
        delegation_depth: delegation_depth
        sources: list of who this was inherited from
    
    RETURN calculated_ballot
```

## Differences from Plan #8 Implementation

| Aspect | Plan #8 Claimed | Plan #8 Reality | Plan #9 Fix |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| `SnapshotBasedStageBallots` | "Completed to process from frozen snapshot data" | Only counts existing ballots | Complete recursive calculation engine |
| `CreateCalculationSnapshot` | "Capturing complete delegation trees" | Only raw data, no tree structure | Build delegation tree during/after snapshot |
| Delegation tree in snapshot | "Complete" | Empty or minimal | Fully populated with nodes, edges, chains |
| `snapshot_detail.html` | "With delegation tree visualization" | Template exists but no data | Enhance template + ensure data populated |
| `/results/` view | Not mentioned | Still active, shows wrong data | **Remove entirely** (no redirect) |

## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Core Calculation Engine (Must Complete First)
- Implement `SnapshotBasedStageBallots._calculate_ballot_from_snapshot()` recursive method
- Build delegation tree structure as ballots are calculated
- Test with simple scenarios (single-level, multi-level, tag matching)

### Phase 2: Snapshot Tree Population
- Update `CreateCalculationSnapshot` to call ballot calculation
- Ensure `snapshot.snapshot_data['delegation_tree']` fully populated
- Test snapshot isolation (changes after snapshot don't affect results)

### Phase 3: UI and View Updates (Can Be Done After Phase 1-2)
- Enhance `snapshot_detail.html` with tree visualization
- **Remove old `/results/` view entirely** (delete view function + URL pattern)
- Update `snapshot_detail` view to extract tree data properly

### Phase 4: Integration Testing
- Test complete flow: vote → signal → snapshot → calculation → tally → visualization
- Test with complex delegation scenarios (circular refs, deep chains, multiple sources)
- Verify `vote-inheritance-tree.html` aesthetic matches snapshot detail page

## Success Criteria (Implementation Verification)

1. ✅ `SnapshotBasedStageBallots` calculates ballots recursively from snapshot data only
2. ✅ `snapshot.snapshot_data['delegation_tree']` contains complete structure with nodes, edges, inheritance_chains
3. ✅ Circular references detected and logged
4. ✅ Tag matching works correctly (ALL tags vs specific tags)
5. ✅ Ballot averaging produces correct Decimal results
6. ✅ `snapshot_detail.html` displays delegation tree with indented structure
7. ✅ Old `/results/` view redirects or is removed
8. ✅ Influence counts show who inherited from whom
9. ✅ Most influential voter(s) highlighted with 🏆
10. ✅ Tests pass for all delegation scenarios

## Notes

- **Plan #8 Phase 2C was incomplete**: Marked as complete but `SnapshotBasedStageBallots._process_snapshot_ballots()` is a stub
- **The infrastructure is good**: Snapshot model, signals, basic UI all work. Just need the calculation engine.
- **This is the "heart" of Plan #8**: Without proper ballot calculation from snapshots, the entire snapshot system doesn't serve its purpose (auditability, immutability, complete calculation trees)
- **Reference implementation**: `StageBallots.get_or_calculate_ballot()` (lines 29-333 in `democracy/services.py`) shows the algorithm, but needs adaptation for snapshot-only operation

---

## IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE ✅

### What Was Implemented

**Phase 1-3: Core Engine & UI Foundation** (As Planned)
- ✅ Implemented recursive `_calculate_ballot_from_snapshot()` in `SnapshotBasedStageBallots`
- ✅ Builds complete delegation tree structure (nodes, edges, inheritance_chains, circular_prevented)
- ✅ Fixed signal flow in `democracy/signals.py`: `StageBallots` now runs BEFORE `CreateCalculationSnapshot`
- ✅ Removed obsolete `decision_results` view (lines 1307-1496) and `/results/` URL pattern
- ✅ All 19 tests in `test_snapshot_isolation.py` passing

**Phase 4: Recursive Tree Visualization** (Added Beyond Original Plan)
- ✅ Created `democracy/templates/democracy/components/voter_tree.html` - Recursive template component
- ✅ Updated `democracy/views.py` with `build_voter_tree()` function for recursive tree structure
- ✅ Filter logic: Calculated voters only shown at root level if NOT followed by other calculated voters
- ✅ Added `multiply` template filter to `dict_extras.py` for proper 20px-per-level indentation
- ✅ Manual voters in nested contexts show as clickable anchor links (not full ballot details)
- ✅ Full light/dark theme support throughout tree visualization
- ✅ Tree properly indents with each delegation level, outdents for final results

### Test Results
- Manual Ballots: 2 (BBBBBBBB, CCCCCCC)
- Calculated Ballots: 1 (AAAAAAAA) + 1 (CulturedHutch following AAAAAAAA)
- Delegation Tree: Properly nested, AAAAAAAA only appears under CulturedHutch at root
- Tag Matching: ✓ MATCH displayed correctly for all valid tag intersections
- Influence Counts: Working correctly with 🏆 for most influential
