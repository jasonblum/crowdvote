# Change 0010: Fix Signal Duplication and Database Connection Exhaustion

## Problem Statement

CrowdVote's signal system is spawning multiple threads per user action, causing:
1. **Database connection exhaustion**: "FATAL: sorry, too many clients already" errors
2. **Perpetual spinner**: Global processing indicator spins constantly even when no calculations are active
3. **Performance degradation**: 2-3x more background threads than necessary

### Root Causes Identified

1. **Duplicate Signal Handlers on Ballot Model**
   - `ballot_changed` (line 167) fires on ALL ballot saves
   - `ballot_tags_changed` (line 391) ALSO fires on ALL ballot saves
   - Result: Every ballot action spawns 2 threads instead of 1

2. **Broken Tag Change Detection Logic**
   - `ballot_tags_changed` attempts to detect tag changes by re-fetching the ballot from database
   - Logic fails because it fetches AFTER the save completes, so old and new values are identical
   - Signal fires on every ballot update regardless of whether tags actually changed
   - Code at democracy/signals.py:409-411

3. **Potential Stuck Snapshots**
   - Snapshots stuck in `['creating', 'ready', 'staging', 'tallying']` states never reach 'completed'
   - Global indicator polls these statuses and shows spinner as long as any exist
   - No timeout mechanism to mark stale snapshots as failed

4. **Aggressive Polling**
   - base.html:620-624 polls `/status/global-calculations/` every 5 seconds continuously
   - Each poll makes database queries via crowdvote/views.py:114-229
   - Contributes to connection pool pressure

## Expected Behavior: TTEs (Tally-Triggering Events)

CrowdVote defines exactly **5 Tally-Triggering Events** that should spawn calculations:

| TTE | User Action | Expected Threads | Current Threads | File/Signal |
|-----|-------------|------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| 1. Voting | Cast or update ballot | 1 | **2-3** ‚ùå | signals.py:167,391 |
| 2. Following | Follow another member | 1 | 1 ‚úì | signals.py:248 |
| 3. Unfollowing | Unfollow a member | 1 | 1 ‚úì | signals.py:291 |
| 4. Tag Change | Modify following tags | 1 | 1 ‚úì | signals.py:248 |
| 5. ALL Tags Switch | Toggle specific‚Üîall tags | 1 | 1 ‚úì | signals.py:248 |

**Critical Requirement**: Each TTE should spawn exactly ONE background thread that:
1. Runs `recalculate_community_decisions_async` (signals.py:38)
2. Creates one snapshot per open decision
3. Stages ballots and tallies results
4. Closes database connection in `finally` block
5. Completes within 2-5 seconds for typical demo data

**Global Spinner Behavior**: Should spin ONLY while background threads are actively processing:
- Blue spinning: Active calculations (snapshots in 'creating', 'staging', 'tallying')
- Gray static: No active calculations
- Stops spinning when snapshot reaches 'completed' status

## Files Requiring Changes

### Primary Changes
- `democracy/signals.py` - Remove duplicate signal, add validation logging
- `democracy/management/commands/check_stuck_snapshots.py` - New diagnostic command
- `democracy/models.py` - Add snapshot timeout method
- `crowdvote/templates/base.html` - Optimize polling frequency

### Supporting Changes
- `democracy/tests/test_signals.py` - Add tests for single-thread-per-TTE
- `docker-compose.yml` - Already has max_connections=200 (keep as-is)

## Resolution Strategy

### Phase 1: Remove Duplicate Signal (Immediate Fix)

**File**: `democracy/signals.py`

1. **Delete `ballot_tags_changed` signal entirely** (lines 391-433)
   - This signal is redundant with `ballot_changed`
   - Its tag-change detection logic is broken
   - Ballot updates are already handled by `ballot_changed`

2. **Add thread spawn logging to remaining signals**:
   ```python
   # In each signal that spawns threads, add:
   thread_id = threading.get_ident()
   logger.info(f"[THREAD_SPAWN] TTE='{trigger_event}' THREAD_ID={thread_id} COMMUNITY={community.name}")
   ```

3. **Add signal registration check**:
   ```python
   # At module level, add validation:
   def validate_signal_registration():
       """Ensure no duplicate signals registered."""
       ballot_receivers = post_save._live_receivers(Ballot)
       logger.info(f"[SIGNAL_CHECK] Ballot post_save has {len(ballot_receivers)} receivers")
   ```

### Phase 2: Add Snapshot Timeout Mechanism

**File**: `democracy/models.py` - Add to `DecisionSnapshot` model:

```python
@classmethod
def mark_stuck_snapshots_as_failed(cls, timeout_minutes=10):
    """
    Find snapshots stuck in processing states and mark them as failed.
    
    Args:
        timeout_minutes: How long before considering snapshot stuck
        
    Returns:
        int: Number of snapshots marked as failed
    """
    from django.utils import timezone
    from datetime import timedelta
    
    cutoff_time = timezone.now() - timedelta(minutes=timeout_minutes)
    stuck_snapshots = cls.objects.filter(
        calculation_status__in=['creating', 'staging', 'tallying'],
        created_at__lt=cutoff_time
    )
    
    count = stuck_snapshots.count()
    stuck_snapshots.update(
        calculation_status='failed_timeout',
        error_log='Calculation timed out after {} minutes'.format(timeout_minutes),
        last_error=timezone.now()
    )
    
    return count
```

**File**: `democracy/management/commands/check_stuck_snapshots.py` - New command:

```python
"""
Management command to diagnose and optionally fix stuck snapshots.

Usage:
  python manage.py check_stuck_snapshots              # Diagnose only
  python manage.py check_stuck_snapshots --fix        # Mark as failed
  python manage.py check_stuck_snapshots --timeout 5  # Custom timeout
"""
```

### Phase 3: Optimize Global Spinner Polling

**File**: `crowdvote/templates/base.html` - Line 620-624:

Current (problematic):
```javascript
const constantPollInterval = setInterval(() => {
    if (!isPolling && !pollingTimeout) {
        pollGlobalStatus();
    }
}, 5000); // Poll every 5 seconds
```

Proposed:
```javascript
// Only poll when necessary - adaptive polling
let pollInterval = 10000; // Start at 10 seconds

const constantPollInterval = setInterval(() => {
    if (!isPolling && !pollingTimeout) {
        pollGlobalStatus();
    }
}, pollInterval); // Use dynamic interval
```

**File**: `democracy/models.py` - Update DecisionSnapshot choices:

Add new status:
```python
('failed_timeout', 'Calculation Timed Out'),
```

## Debugging and Validation

### Debugging Steps

**1. Check Current Signal Registration**:
```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py shell
>>> from django.db.models.signals import post_save
>>> from democracy.models import Ballot
>>> receivers = post_save._live_receivers(Ballot)
>>> for r in receivers:
...     print(f"Receiver: {r}")
```

**Expected**: Should see 2 receivers before fix, 1 after fix

**2. Monitor Thread Spawning**:
```bash
# Watch logs in real-time
docker-compose logs -f web | grep "THREAD_SPAWN\|ASYNC_RECALC_TRIGGERED"
```

**Expected output per TTE**:
```
[THREAD_SPAWN] TTE='ballot_cast' THREAD_ID=140562856827776 COMMUNITY=Minion Collective
[ASYNC_RECALC_TRIGGERED] [system] - Background recalculation started for community Minion Collective
```

Should see EXACTLY 1 pair per user action.

**3. Find Stuck Snapshots**:
```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py check_stuck_snapshots
```

**Expected output**:
```
üîç Checking for stuck snapshots...
Found 3 stuck snapshots:
  - Decision "Banana Budget" (staging, 45 minutes old)
  - Decision "World Domination" (tallying, 2 hours old)
  - Decision "Lair Location" (creating, 1 day old)

Run with --fix to mark these as failed.
```

**4. Monitor Database Connections**:
```bash
docker-compose exec db psql -U postgres -d crowdvote_dev -c "SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE datname='crowdvote_dev';"
```

**Expected**: Should stay under 20 connections during normal operation (max is 200)

**5. Test Global Spinner State**:
```javascript
// In browser console on any page
fetch('/status/global-calculations/')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
```

**Expected output (when idle)**:
```json
{
  "has_active_calculations": false,
  "has_recent_activity": false,
  "decisions": []
}
```

### Validation Tests

**Test 1: Single Ballot Cast**
```bash
# Start with clean logs
docker-compose logs -f web > /tmp/crowdvote.log &

# In browser: Login, navigate to decision, cast ballot

# Check logs
grep -c "ASYNC_RECALC_TRIGGERED" /tmp/crowdvote.log
```
‚úÖ **PASS**: Count should be exactly 1
‚ùå **FAIL**: Count is 2 or more

**Test 2: Follow Member**
```bash
# Clear logs
docker-compose restart web

# In browser: Follow a member on specific tags

# Check logs  
docker-compose logs web | grep "FOLLOWING_STARTED\|ASYNC_RECALC_TRIGGERED"
```
‚úÖ **PASS**: See 1 FOLLOWING_STARTED + 1 ASYNC_RECALC_TRIGGERED
‚ùå **FAIL**: See multiple ASYNC_RECALC_TRIGGERED

**Test 3: Unfollow Member**
```bash
# In browser: Unfollow the member

# Check logs
docker-compose logs web | grep "FOLLOWING_DELETED\|ASYNC_RECALC_TRIGGERED"
```
‚úÖ **PASS**: See 1 FOLLOWING_DELETED + 1 ASYNC_RECALC_TRIGGERED
‚ùå **FAIL**: Multiple recalculation triggers

**Test 4: Global Spinner Behavior**
```bash
# Start calculation
# Cast ballot in browser

# Watch spinner in top-right corner:
# 1. Should turn blue and spin immediately
# 2. Hover over it - should show "Currently Processing"
# 3. Wait 2-5 seconds
# 4. Should turn gray and stop spinning
# 5. Hover - should show "Recent Activity (24h)"
```
‚úÖ **PASS**: Spinner follows above sequence
‚ùå **FAIL**: Spinner keeps spinning indefinitely

**Test 5: Database Connection Stability**
```bash
# Run stress test: cast 20 ballots rapidly
for i in {1..20}; do
  # Cast ballot in browser
  sleep 1
done

# Check for errors
docker-compose logs web | grep "too many clients"
```
‚úÖ **PASS**: No "too many clients" errors
‚ùå **FAIL**: See connection errors

**Test 6: Stuck Snapshot Cleanup**
```bash
# Check for stuck snapshots
docker-compose exec web python manage.py check_stuck_snapshots

# If found, mark them as failed
docker-compose exec web python manage.py check_stuck_snapshots --fix

# Verify spinner stops
# Visit any page, check that spinner is gray/static
```
‚úÖ **PASS**: Stuck snapshots marked as failed, spinner stops
‚ùå **FAIL**: Spinner still spinning after cleanup

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
1. ‚úÖ Each TTE spawns exactly 1 background thread
2. ‚úÖ No duplicate signal handlers on Ballot model
3. ‚úÖ Global spinner accurately reflects calculation state
4. ‚úÖ Spinner stops within 10 seconds of calculation completing
5. ‚úÖ Stuck snapshots auto-timeout after 10 minutes

### Performance Requirements
1. ‚úÖ Database connections stay under 50 during normal operation
2. ‚úÖ No "too many clients" errors under any user load
3. ‚úÖ Ballot submission completes in <1 second (user-facing)
4. ‚úÖ Background calculation completes in 2-5 seconds (demo data)

### Monitoring Requirements
1. ‚úÖ Thread spawn events logged with TTE identifier
2. ‚úÖ Connection close events logged in background threads
3. ‚úÖ Management command available to diagnose stuck snapshots
4. ‚úÖ Clear log patterns for each TTE type

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise after deploying these changes:

1. **Immediate**: Revert `democracy/signals.py` to restore `ballot_tags_changed`
2. **Temporary fix**: Disable automatic recalculation by commenting out signal receivers
3. **Manual fallback**: Use `python manage.py stage_snapshot_and_tally_ballots` to calculate on demand

## Additional Issue Discovered During Testing

### Infinite Cascade from Calculated Ballots

**Problem**: Following a user triggered an infinite cascade creating 471+ snapshots instead of 2.

**Root Cause**: 
- `ballot_changed` signal fires on ALL ballot saves (both manual and calculated)
- When user follows someone ‚Üí triggers recalculation
- Recalculation calculates inherited ballots and SAVES them to database
- Those ballot saves trigger `ballot_changed` signal again
- New signal spawns another thread ‚Üí calculates more ballots ‚Üí saves them ‚Üí triggers signal
- **Infinite loop!**

**Solution**: Modified `ballot_changed` and `ballot_deleted` signals to ignore calculated ballots:

```python
@receiver(post_save, sender=Ballot)
def ballot_changed(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
    # CRITICAL: Ignore calculated ballots to prevent infinite cascade
    if instance.is_calculated:
        logger.debug(f"[BALLOT_CALCULATED_SKIP] - Skipping recalculation for calculated ballot")
        return
    # ... rest of signal handler
```

**Result**: Only manual ballots (user-cast votes) trigger recalculation. Calculated ballots created during delegation processing do not spawn new threads.

---

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)

- Celery/Redis task queue for better background job management
- Rate limiting on signal triggers to prevent rapid-fire recalculations
- Snapshot deduplication (skip if identical snapshot created <30 seconds ago)
- Real-time WebSocket updates instead of polling for spinner state
