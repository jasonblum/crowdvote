# Change 0008: Event-Driven Ballot Calculation with System Snapshots

## Description

Fundamentally redesign CrowdVote's ballot calculation and tallying system to be event-driven, efficient, and fully auditable. Replace the current community-wide recalculation approach with targeted affected-user calculation, timestamped system snapshots, and persistent historical records.

## What's Changing vs What's Staying the Same

### ‚úÖ Staying the Same (Already Working)

1. **Signals in `democracy/signals.py`** - Already implemented and working correctly:
   - Vote changed/deleted signals ‚úÖ
   - Following changed/deleted signals ‚úÖ
   - Membership changed/deleted signals ‚úÖ
   - Background threading with `recalculate_community_decisions_async()` ‚úÖ
   - HTMX spinner integration ‚úÖ
   - Comprehensive logging ‚úÖ

2. **DecisionSnapshot Model** - Already exists in `democracy/models.py`:
   - Complete model with all required fields ‚úÖ
   - Proper indexes and ordering ‚úÖ
   - Status tracking ‚úÖ

3. **Snapshot Services (Partially)** - Already exist:
   - `CreateCalculationSnapshot` service exists ‚úÖ
   - `SnapshotBasedStageBallots` service exists (needs completion) ‚ö†Ô∏è

### üîÑ What's Changing (The Big Refactor)

1. **`StageBallots` Service** - Major refactoring needed:
   - ‚ùå Currently uses `round(average, 2)` - loses precision
   - ‚ùå Mixes float and Decimal types
   - ‚úÖ Need to use Decimal throughout
   - ‚úÖ Need to preserve full fractional star precision

2. **`Tally` Service** - Complete rewrite needed:
   - ‚ùå Has custom STAR voting implementation (lines 26-182)
   - ‚ùå Does not use Plan #7 `STARVotingTally` class
   - ‚úÖ Need to integrate `democracy/star_voting.py`
   - ‚úÖ Need to support fractional stars properly

3. **SnapshotBasedStageBallots** - Needs full implementation:
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Currently returns placeholder data
   - ‚úÖ Need to integrate with refactored StageBallots logic
   - ‚úÖ Need to work from frozen snapshot data only

4. **UI (Future Phase)** - New components:
   - Historical results table using Plan #4 DataTables
   - Snapshot detail page with delegation tree visualization

### üí° Key Insight

**The infrastructure is already there!** The signals work, the snapshot model exists, and the three-step process is already called. What we're doing is:
1. Making the calculation services support fractional stars properly (Decimal precision)
2. Integrating Plan #7's STAR voting implementation
3. Completing the snapshot-based calculation implementation
4. Adding UI to view the historical snapshots

## Critical Context

This is **the heart of CrowdVote's democratic process**. The current system has two fundamental problems:

### Problem 1: Inefficient Full-Community Recalculation

**Current behavior:** When anyone votes, the system loops through the entire community, recursively calculating ballots for everyone who hasn't voted manually.

**New behavior:** When someone votes (or follows/unfollows), only calculate ballots for users **affected by that specific change**. Walk down the delegation tree from the trigger event.

**Example:**
- C votes manually (tags: "budget")
- A follows C on "budget"
- D follows A on "all tags"
- E follows D on "budget"

When C votes ‚Üí Signal fires ‚Üí Calculate: A's ballot (inherits from C), D's ballot (inherits from A), E's ballot (inherits from D)

Remember that in this very simple example above, each user is only inherting from one person.  But in reality, people will be following multiple people, who are them selves following multiplel peoplem, etc.  This process much average the stars across ballots to calculate each follower's ballot.

**Do NOT calculate ballots for unrelated community members.**.

### Problem 2: Misuse of STAR Voting for Ballot Calculation

**Current behavior:** Using STAR voting (which returns a **winner**) to calculate individual member ballots.

**Reality:** STAR voting determines election winners, not individual ballots.

**Correct approach:** 
- **Ballot calculation** = Simple averaging of inherited star ratings
- **Final tally** = STAR voting on all ballots (from Plan #7)

**Example of ballot calculation:**
```
B's ballot: {apple: 3, banana: 2, orange: 5} tagged ["budget"]
C's ballot: {apple: 5, banana: 2, orange: 0} tagged ["budget"]

A follows B on ["budget"]
A follows C on ["budget"]

A's calculated ballot:
- apple: (3 + 5) / 2 = 4.0
- banana: (2 + 2) / 2 = 2.0
- orange: (5 + 0) / 2 = 2.5
- tags: ["budget"] (intersection of A's following tags with B and C's ballot tags)
```

## Three-Step Process

### Step 1: Calculate Affected Ballots

**Trigger events (signals already implemented):**
1. Vote cast/updated
2. Following created/deleted
3. Following tags changed
4. Membership changed
5. Decision published/closed

**When signal fires:**
- Identify the "source" user (who voted/was followed/etc.)
- Walk DOWN the delegation tree to find affected users
- Calculate ballots only for affected users
- Use simple averaging with tag matching

### Step 2: Create System Snapshot

**Critical requirement:** Grab a timestamped snapshot of the **entire system state** before tallying.

**Why:** The tally process may take time. During tallying, users might vote/follow/unfollow, which would corrupt the results. The snapshot freezes the system state at a point in time.

**Snapshot contents:**
- Timestamp
- All ballots (manual + calculated) with star ratings
- All delegation relationships (who follows whom on which tags)
- Complete calculation trees (how each ballot was calculated)
- Anonymous/non-anonymous status
- Final vs. interim status

**Snapshot = Single source of truth for that point in time**

### Step 3: Tally Using STAR Voting

Run STAR voting tally (Plan #7 implementation) on the ballots captured in the snapshot. The tally operates on snapshot data, not live system data.

## Tag Inheritance Logic

**CRITICAL CLARIFICATION:** 
- **Choices are NEVER tagged** (apple, banana, hotdog are not tagged)
- **Decisions are tagged** (the question "What should we eat for lunch?" is tagged)
- When you vote, you tag the DECISION with terms like ["budget", "environment"]
- Others following you on matching tags inherit your ENTIRE BALLOT + matching tags

**Critical rule:** You inherit ballots AND tags where tags match.

### Tag Matching Examples

**Example 1: Specific tag following**
```
Decision: "What should we eat for lunch?" (Choices: apple, banana, hotdog)
B votes: {apple: 5, banana: 3, hotdog: 2} and tags the DECISION ["budget", "environment", "infrastructure"]
A follows B on ["budget"]
A inherits: {apple: 5, banana: 3, hotdog: 2} tagged ["budget"]  ‚Üê full ballot, tag intersection only
```

**Example 2: ALL tags following**
```
Decision: "Community room color" (Choices: gray, blue, green)
B votes: {gray: 5, blue: 2, green: 0} and tags the DECISION ["budget", "environment", "infrastructure"]
A follows B on [ALL tags]
A inherits: {gray: 5, blue: 2, green: 0} tagged ["budget", "environment", "infrastructure"]  ‚Üê full ballot, all tags
```

**Example 3: Tag propagation blocking**
```
Decision: "Park renovation" (Choices: playground, garden, trails)
B votes: {playground: 5, garden: 3, trails: 2} and tags DECISION ["budget", "environment"]
A follows B on ["budget"]
A's inherited ballot: {playground: 5, garden: 3, trails: 2} tagged ["budget"]  ‚Üê tag intersection

D follows A on ["environment"]
D CANNOT inherit from A (A's ballot not tagged "environment")
```

**Example 4: Multi-source averaging with tag intersection**
```
Decision: "Weekend menu" (Choices: pizza, tacos, sushi)
B votes: {pizza: 5, tacos: 2, sushi: 1} and tags DECISION ["budget"]
C votes: {pizza: 3, tacos: 4, sushi: 2} and tags DECISION ["budget", "infrastructure"]

A follows B on ["budget"]
A follows C on ["budget"]

A inherits from both (both have "budget" tag):
- Full ballot averaged: pizza: (5 + 3) / 2 = 4.0, tacos: (2 + 4) / 2 = 3.0, sushi: (1 + 2) / 2 = 1.5
- tags: ["budget"]  ‚Üê intersection of ["budget"] with B's ["budget"] and C's ["budget", "infrastructure"]
```

### Recursive Calculation with Circular Prevention

**Algorithm:**
```python
def calculate_ballot(user, decision, follow_path=[], affected_users_only=False):
    """

        )

                inherited.append((followee_ballot, matched_tags))
        else:  # ALL tags
            inherited.append((followee_ballot, followee_tags))
    
    if not inherited:
        return None, []  # No matching tags
    
    # Average all inherited ballots
    averaged_ballot = {}
    all_tags = set()
    
    for ballot, tags in inherited:
        for choice, stars in ballot.items():
            averaged_ballot[choice] = averaged_ballot.get(choice, Decimal(0)) + stars
        all_tags.update(tags)
    
    num_sources = len(inherited)
    averaged_ballot = {
        choice: stars / num_sources 
        for choice, stars in averaged_ballot.items()

```

## Service Layer Redesign

### File: `democracy/services.py`

**IMPORTANT:** We will be **refactoring the existing services**, not creating entirely new ones. The existing `StageBallots` and `Tally` services need major refactoring because the old implementation did not support fractional stars (Plan #7 changed this).

**Refactored `StageBallots` service:**

```python
class StageBallots(Service):
    """
    Calculate ballots for ALL users in a decision (for manual testing/commands).
    
    This service now:
    - Supports fractional star ratings (Decimal)
    - Uses simple averaging (not STAR voting) for ballot calculation
    - Properly handles tag inheritance and matching
    - Tracks delegation trees for visualization
    
    For event-driven updates, signals will call this service targeting only
    affected users (implementation detail handled by the service).
    
    Input (via process() method):
        No explicit input - processes all open decisions
        
    Output:
        {
            'delegation_trees': {decision_id: tree_data},
            'ballots_calculated': int,
            'calculation_trees': [detailed logs],
            'circular_prevented': int
        }
    """
```

**Existing `CreateCalculationSnapshot` and `SnapshotBasedStageBallots` services:**

These services already exist (see lines 791-1019 in `democracy/services.py`) but need refactoring to:
- Integrate with refactored `StageBallots` logic
- Support fractional star ratings throughout
- Use Plan #7 STAR voting for final tally

**Refactored `Tally` service:**

```python
class Tally(Service):
    """
    Run STAR voting tally on ballots from a decision.
    
    Now uses Plan #7 STAR voting implementation (democracy/star_voting.py)
    with full Decimal support for fractional star ratings.
    
    Input (via process() method):
        No explicit input - processes all open decisions
        
    Output:
        HTML-formatted tally report with:
        - Score phase results
        - Automatic runoff results
        - Winner determination
        - Tag analysis
    """
```

## Management Command Redesign

### File: `democracy/management/commands/stage_and_tally_ballots.py`

**Complete rewrite to use new three-step process:**

```python
class Command(BaseCommand):
    """
    DEPRECATED: This command now only for manual testing.
    
    In production, signals automatically trigger:
    1. CalculateAffectedBallots (Step 1)
    2. CreateSystemSnapshot (Step 2)
    3. TallyFromSnapshot (Step 3)
    
    This command is useful for:
    - Manual recalculation after data fixes
    - Testing the full pipeline
    - Debugging calculation issues
    """
    
    def handle(self, *args, **options):
        # For each open decision:
        #   1. Calculate all ballots (not just affected - manual mode)
        #   2. Create snapshot
        #   3. Run tally
        #   4. Display results matching vote-inheritance-tree.html format
```

## UI Changes

### Decision Detail Page: Results Table

**File: `democracy/templates/democracy/decision_detail.html`**

**Replace left sidebar "Live Results" section with bottom-of-page historical results table.**

**Current (to remove):**
```
üìä Live Results
üü¢ Live
Voting closes in: 11d 9h 57m 23s
Participation 16/34 (47.1%)
Calculation Calculating Votes...
üìã Complete Results & Analysis
```

**New: Historical Results Table (bottom of page)**

Use DataTables component from Plan #4 (reusable pattern).

**Columns:**
1. **Timestamp** - When snapshot was taken (sortable, default desc)
2. **Status** - Badge: "üî¥ FINAL" (closed decision) or "üü¢ Interim" (open decision)
3. **Winner** - Choice title that won
4. **Participation** - "16/34 (47.1%)" - manual + calculated / total members
5. **Manual Ballots** - Count of directly cast ballots
6. **Calculated** - Count of inherited ballots
7. **Action** - "View Details" button ‚Üí links to snapshot detail page

### New Page: Snapshot Detail/Results

**File: `democracy/templates/democracy/snapshot_detail.html`**

**URL:** `/communities/<uuid>/decisions/<uuid>/snapshots/<uuid>/`

**Content structure (modeled after vote-inheritance-tree.html):**

1. **Header stats:**
   - Manual: 8
   - Calculated: 41
   - Circular Prevented: 10
   - No Ballot: 16 (can't calculate)
   - Max Depth: 14 levels

2. **Stage 1: Manual Ballots**
   - List all manual voters
   - Show their ballots and tags
   - Show influence count (N) = # of people who inherited from this voter
   - üèÜ for most influential voter(s)

3. **Stage 2: Calculated Ballots (Delegation)**
   - Show delegation trees with indentation
   - For each calculated ballot:
     - Show user (anonymous if applicable)
     - Show who they follow (with tags)
     - Show tag matching results (‚úì MATCH or ‚úó NO MATCH)
     - Show circular references (‚ö†Ô∏è Circular reference prevented)
     - Show final calculated ballot and inherited tags
   - Use color coding:
     - üü¢ Manual voters
     - üîµ Calculated voters
     - üü† Circular prevented

4. **Stage 3: No Ballot Calculated**
   - List users with no ballot
   - Show reason: "not following anyone" or "following others but no tag matches"

5. **Stage 4: STAR Voting Tally**
   - Show score phase results (average stars per choice)
   - Show automatic runoff results (preferences between top 2)
   - Show winner with margin

**Visual style:** Match vote-inheritance-tree.html dark theme, monospace font, indented trees

## Signal Integration (Already Exists)

**File: `democracy/signals.py`** (from legacy Plan #22)

**Update signal handlers to call new three-step process:**

```python
def vote_changed(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
    """
    Triggered when Vote is saved.
    
    New behavior:
    1. Call CalculateAffectedBallots (only users affected by this vote)
    2. Call CreateSystemSnapshot
    3. Call TallyFromSnapshot
    """

def following_changed(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    """
    Triggered when Following is created/deleted/modified.
    
    New behavior:
    1. Find all decisions in affected communities
    2. For each decision, run three-step process
    """

**What we have:**
- Complete model with all required fields
- Proper indexes and ordering
- Status tracking fields (calculation_status, error_log, etc.)
- JSON field for snapshot_data
- Validation logic

**What needs checking:**
1. Review existing model against plan requirements
2. Ensure all fields match plan specification

**‚úã APPROVAL GATE 2A:** StageBallots refactored and tested with fractional stars

---

### Phase 2B: Integrate STAR Voting from Plan #7

**File:** `democracy/services.py` lines 600-788 (Tally service)

**Current issues:**
- Tally service has custom STAR voting implementation
- Does NOT use `democracy/star_voting.py` from Plan #7
- Needs complete rewrite to use STARVotingTally class

**Changes needed:**

1. **Import Plan #7 STAR voting:**
```python
from .star_voting import STARVotingTally
from decimal import Decimal
```

2. **Rewrite Tally.process() to use STARVotingTally:**
   - Remove custom `score()` and `automatic_runoff()` methods
   - Build ballot list in correct format for STARVotingTally

**Changes needed:**

1. **Update CreateCalculationSnapshot:**
   - Verify Decimal handling in snapshot_data
   - Ensure all star ratings stored as strings in JSON
   - Check membership/following capture logic

2. **Implement SnapshotBasedStageBallots:**

   - Signals already call CreateCalculationSnapshot
   - Signals already call SnapshotBasedStageBallots  
   - Signals already call Tally
   - Just verify they're using refactored services correctly

2. **No structural changes needed** - existing signal handlers are fine:
   - vote_changed ‚úÖ
   - following_changed ‚úÖ
   - membership_changed ‚úÖ
   - etc.

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Verify signals call refactored services
- [ ] Test signal ‚Üí snapshot ‚Üí tally flow

**‚úã FINAL APPROVAL:** Plan #8 complete and production-ready

## Critical Implementation Notes

### Use Decimal, Not Float

```python
from decimal import Decimal

# When calculating ballots
stars = Decimal('3.7')  # Precise
stars = 3.7  # Avoid - float precision issues

# When averaging
avg = sum(star_values) / Decimal(len(star_values))
```

### Affected Users Algorithm

**Walking DOWN the delegation tree:**

```python
def find_affected_users(trigger_user, decision):
    """
    Find all users whose ballots need recalculation.
    
    Walk down from trigger_user to find everyone who follows them
    (directly or indirectly through delegation chains).
    """
    affected = set()
    
    def walk_down(user, visited=set()):
        if user in visited:
            return  # Circular
        visited.add(user)
        
        # Find everyone who follows this user in this community
        followers = Following.objects.filter(
            followee=user,
            community=decision.community
        )
        
        for following in followers:
            follower = following.follower
            affected.add(follower)
            walk_down(follower, visited.copy())
    
    walk_down(trigger_user)
    return affected
```

### Snapshot Immutability

**Once created, snapshots are NEVER modified.** They are historical records.

- No updates to snapshot_data after creation
- Tally results are written once
- If re-tally needed, create new snapshot

### Keeping Snapshots Forever

**No automatic deletion.** Snapshots are the audit trail.

- Database storage is cheap
- Transparency requires complete history
- Admin interface can manually delete if absolutely necessary
- Consider database backups/archiving for very old snapshots (years)

## Success Criteria

1. ‚úÖ Vote triggers calculation of only affected users (not entire community)
2. ‚úÖ Ballot calculation uses simple averaging (not STAR voting)
3. ‚úÖ Tag inheritance works correctly (intersection + ALL tags)
4. ‚úÖ Circular references detected and logged
5. ‚úÖ Fractional stars handled throughout (using Decimal)
6. ‚úÖ System snapshots created with complete data structure
7. ‚úÖ Snapshots frozen and immutable after creation
8. ‚úÖ STAR tally operates on snapshot data (Plan #7 implementation)
9. ‚úÖ Historical results table displays all snapshots
10. ‚úÖ Snapshot detail page visualizes calculation trees
11. ‚úÖ All snapshots kept forever (no automatic deletion)
12. ‚úÖ Signals trigger three-step process automatically
13. ‚úÖ Tests maintain 100% success rate
14. ‚úÖ Complex delegation scenarios work correctly

## Dependencies

**Requires Plan #7 completion:** This plan depends on having a working STAR voting implementation with float support.

## Notes

- This is the most complex change in CrowdVote history
- Take time to implement carefully and test thoroughly
- Tag inheritance is subtle - test extensively
- Snapshot structure mirrors vote-inheritance-tree.html visualization
- The three-step process ensures data integrity during concurrent changes
- Event-driven calculation is vastly more efficient than full community loops
- Complete audit trail satisfies transparency requirements
