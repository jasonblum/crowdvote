# Plan #14: Testing Coverage Expansion to 60-70% - Regression Prevention & Quality Assurance

## Overview

**Current State**: 29% test coverage with critical gaps in views (7%), forms (0%), and tree service (0%)
**Target Goal**: 60-70% overall coverage to prevent regression bugs as the application matures
**Primary Focus**: High-impact areas most likely to break during continued development

## Context & Motivation

The CrowdVote application has reached a mature state with:
- Complete full-width UI layout system
- Comprehensive democracy and delegation functionality  
- User authentication and community management
- Complex business logic in services and models

As development continues, we need robust testing to prevent regression bugs. The current 29% coverage leaves critical functionality untested, particularly:
- User-facing views and form validation (most likely to break with UI changes)
- Core democratic algorithms (delegation trees, STAR voting)
- Authentication and security workflows

## Technical Strategy

### Phase 1: Forms Testing (0% → 90%+) - ✅ **COMPLETED WITH OUTSTANDING SUCCESS**
**Files**: `democracy/forms.py`, `accounts/forms.py`
