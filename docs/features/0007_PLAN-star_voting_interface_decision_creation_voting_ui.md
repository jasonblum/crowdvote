# Feature 0007: STAR Voting Interface System

## Overview

Build the complete voting interface system that transforms CrowdVote from a social platform into a functional democracy tool. This connects the social foundation from Plan #6 to the existing STAR voting backend from Plan #4, enabling communities to create decisions, vote on them, and see transparent results.

## Context & User Journey

With Plan #6's social foundation complete, users can now discover communities and members. Plan #7 enables the core democratic process:

1. **Community Managers**: Create decisions with multiple choices for their communities
2. **Community Members**: Vote on active decisions using STAR voting (0-5 stars per choice)
3. **Real-Time Results**: See live vote tallies and final STAR voting results
4. **Transparency**: Complete audit trails showing who voted (respecting anonymity preferences)
5. **Democracy in Action**: Transform social connections into actual democratic participation

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Decision Creation Interface

**For Community Managers Only:**
- Create new decisions with title, description, and deadline
- Add multiple choices (minimum 2, maximum 10)
- Set voting deadline (future date/time)
- Preview decision before publishing
- Edit unpublished decisions, lock after first vote

**Decision Creation Form:**
```
Title: [Short descriptive title]
Description: [Detailed explanation of what's being decided]
Voting Deadline: [Date/Time picker]
Choices:
  1. [Choice title] [Choice description] [Remove]
  2. [Choice title] [Choice description] [Remove]
  [+ Add Choice] (up to 10 total)

[Preview] [Save Draft] [Publish Decision]
```

### 2. STAR Voting Interface

**For All Community Members:**
- View active decisions in their communities
- Rate each choice from 0-5 stars with clear UI
- See current vote totals (if not anonymous)
- Submit complete ballot or save draft
- Edit votes until decision closes
- Anonymous voting toggle per decision

**STAR Voting UI:**
```
Decision: What color should we paint the community room?

Your Vote (you can change this anytime before [deadline]):
â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜† Cathedral Gray - Classic and timeless
â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜† Aqua Chiffon - Bright and cheerful  
â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜… Oceanside - Calming blue-green
â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜† Custom Color - [Write-in option]

Tags for this decision: [maintenance] [beautification] [community room]
Vote anonymously: [Toggle] (your preference: Anonymous by default)

[Save Draft] [Submit Vote] [View Current Results]
```

### 3. Decision Discovery & Management

**Decision Lists:**
- **Active Decisions**: Currently open for voting

## Next Phase Integration

Plan #7 creates the foundation for Plan #8 (Delegation Management):
- **Decision Tagging**: Decisions can be tagged with topics for delegation
- **Vote Inheritance**: Framework ready for delegation-based vote calculation

- **Transparency**: Results pages ready to show delegation trees and influence flows

This transforms CrowdVote from a social platform into a working democracy where:
1. **Managers create decisions** â†’ Communities have real issues to vote on
2. **Members vote with STAR system** â†’ Democratic participation happens
3. **Results show transparency** â†’ Trust in the process is maintained
4. **Ready for delegation** â†’ Plan #8 can add vote inheritance seamlessly

**Plan #7 is the bridge between social infrastructure and democratic action.**
