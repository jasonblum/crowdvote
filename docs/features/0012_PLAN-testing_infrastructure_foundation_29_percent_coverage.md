## Critical Test Coverage Areas

### 1. Democracy Services (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**File**: `democracy/services.py`

**Core Functions to Test**:
- `StageBallots` class: vote inheritance algorithms
- `calculate_delegation_chains()`: multi-level delegation
- `handle_circular_references()`: prevent infinite loops
- `inherit_tags_with_votes()`: tag propagation logic  
- `Tally` class: STAR voting calculations
- `calculate_star_results()`: score phase + runoff
- `handle_ties()`: tie-breaking mechanisms

**Test Scenarios**:
- Single-level delegation (B→A)
- Multi-level chains (E→C→A, H→F→C→A)  
- Circular reference prevention (A→B→C, C→A blocked)
- Duplicate inheritance handling (F→A + F→D→C→A = single A vote)
- Tag-specific delegation vs general following
- Lobbyist exclusion from vote counting
- Edge cases: self-following, empty chains, invalid users

### 2. Model Validation & Business Logic

**CustomUser Model** (`accounts/models.py`):
- Username validation and uniqueness
- Avatar generation methods
- Profile field validation (bio, social links)
- Privacy controls functionality

**Following Model** (`accounts/models.py`):
- Tag validation and cleaning
- Order priority handling
- Circular reference prevention
- User relationship constraints

**Community/Membership Models** (`democracy/models.py`):
- Role permission logic (manager, voter, lobbyist)
- Anonymity settings
- Auto-approval workflows

**Decision/Choice/Ballot Models** (`democracy/models.py`):
- STAR voting constraints (0-5 stars)
- Vote validation and uniqueness
- Decision status transitions
- Tag inheritance and storage

### 3. View Permissions & Security

**Authentication & Authorization**:
- Magic link generation and validation
- Login required decorators
- Community membership checks
- Manager-only access controls

**Community Views**:
- `community_detail`: proper member filtering
- `community_manage`: manager permission enforcement
- `manage_application`: application approval workflow

**Decision Views**:
- `decision_create`: manager-only access
- `decision_detail`: member access with proper voting
- `vote_submit`: vote validation and duplicate prevention
- `decision_results`: proper result calculations

### 4. Form Validation & User Input

**DecisionForm & ChoiceFormSet**:
- Title/description length validation
- Future deadline validation
- Choice minimum/maximum constraints
- Duplicate choice prevention

**VoteForm**:
- Star rating validation (0-5 range)
- Tag input cleaning and validation
- At least one choice rated requirement
- Anonymous voting preferences

**Profile Forms**:
- Username availability checking
- Bio length and content validation
- Social media URL validation
- Privacy settings handling

### 5. Integration Workflows

**Complete Voting Process**:
1. Manager creates decision with choices
2. Members cast votes with tags
3. System calculates delegation inheritance
4. STAR voting determines winners
5. Results display with audit trails

**Magic Link Authentication**:
1. User enters email address
2. Magic link generated and sent
3. Link validation and login
4. Profile setup for new users
5. Community discovery and application

**Delegation Setup**:
1. User discovers community members
2. Sets up following relationships with tags
3. Votes are inherited through chains
4. Tag-specific vs general following behavior
5. Vote count accuracy verification

## Test Data & Fixtures

### Factory Classes (using factory_boy)

**UserFactory**:
- Generate realistic usernames and profiles
- Control membership types (voter, lobbyist, manager)
- Set up following relationships with specific patterns

**CommunityFactory**:
- Create communities with varied member counts
- Set up realistic delegation networks
- Include test users A-H pattern for validation

**DecisionFactory**:
- Generate decisions with 2-10 choices
- Create realistic voting scenarios
- Set up past, active, and future decisions

**BallotFactory**:

- Test specific delegation inheritance patterns
- Generate realistic tag usage

### Test Data Patterns

Use existing dummy data patterns from AGENTS.md:
- **Test Users A-H**: Specific delegation relationships for edge case testing
- **Minion Collective & Springfield**: Realistic community scenarios
- **Multi-level Chains**: 2-4 level delegation inheritance
- **Tag Scenarios**: "governance", "budget", "environment", "safety"

## Coverage Requirements & Metrics

### Minimum Coverage Targets
- **Overall**: 80% line coverage
- **Services**: 95% coverage (critical business logic)
- **Models**: 90% coverage (data integrity)
- **Views**: 85% coverage (security & permissions)
- **Forms**: 80% coverage (validation logic)

### Coverage Reporting
- Generate HTML coverage reports
- Track coverage trends over time
- Exclude migrations and third-party code
- Report uncovered lines for priority fixing
