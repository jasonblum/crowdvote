            <p class="text-xl text-gray-600 mb-6">
              For several years now, I've been daydreaming about building a free and Open Source web application 
              to help people make decisions together. And I have two questions for you:
            </p>
            
            <ol class="text-lg font-medium text-gray-900 mb-8">
              <li>Could you use this?</li>
              <li>What would you change?</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              I call it "CrowdVote", and it brings a process I've been calling <strong>Social Democracy</strong> 
              (as in "Social Media" …not the political ideology) to local communities such as condo associations, 
              town councils, student governments, and anywhere else you might want to "crowdsource" decisions to 
              a community of people.
            </p>

            <p>
              Unlike a conventional, web-based polling application however, CrowdVote allows community members to 
              then delegate their votes on to an Instant Runoff between one or more other members whose judgement 
              they trust, <em>whenever -</em> and, specifically, <em>on whichever issues they like</em>.
            </p>

            <p>
              This is done through <strong>tagging</strong> the decisions you are voting on with terms like 
              "<em>budget</em>" or "<em>environment</em>", which allows other members of the community who trust 
              your judgement on such issues, to then <em>follow you</em> (inherit your votes) on those tags.
            </p>

            <p>
              Because votes (and their tags) are transitive, the people from whom you inherit your votes may be 
              inheriting theirs from someone else, and they from someone else, and so on.
            </p>

            <p>
              Trees of influence can emerge organically and evolve to more accurately reflect community sentiment 
              in real time, rather than only once every election cycle.
            </p>

              …because Real Democracy happens between elections.
            </blockquote>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">A Concrete Example</h3>
            
            <p>
              Say a condo board will decide next Tuesday what color to paint the community room.
            </p>

            <p>
              Mary is a board member, and wants to crowdsource her decision on CrowdVote, along with any specific 
              color choices, whether or not folks can write in their own colors, supporting documentation like 
              color codes/swatches, contractor proposals, etc…
            </p>

            <p>
              Her neighbor Jack sees Mary's published question, and responds by casting a Ranked Choice ballot: 
              [ '<em>Cathedral Gray</em>', '<em>Aqua Chiffon</em>', '<em>Oceanside</em>' ]. And if Jack wants to 
              encourage other members of the community to follow him (again, to inherit his ballot) …he'll want 
              to take a moment to further tag Mary's decision with terms he feels characterize her question and, 
              more importantly, on which others in the community can follow him: 
              [ "<em>maintenance</em>", "<em>beautification</em>", "<em>community room</em>" ].
            </p>

            <p>
              Now, if their neighbor Sophia is out of town or fails to cast a ballot before next Tuesday for 
              whatever reason, CrowdVote can attempt to calculate a ballot on her behalf …but only if she has 
              previously identified in her profile other community members whose judgement she trusts sufficiently 
              to follow their positions on decisions like this one. Moreover, she may be inheriting votes from lots 
              of people, on a variety of matters. She may follow Mary on "<em>environmental</em>" issues, Jack on 
              "<em>maintenance</em>" and "<em>budget</em>," and also Susan on "<em>budget</em>". …CrowdVote just 
              figures out who's following whom, on which issues, and runs them all through an Instant Runoff to 
              come up with Sophia's ballot, which she is of course free to override anytime before Tuesday by 
              logging in to CrowdVote and casting her own.
            </p>

            <blockquote class="text-xl font-medium text-center my-8 py-4 border-l-4 border-green-500 pl-6 bg-green-50">
              CrowdVote = Free Market Representation.
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              …Rather than tying Representation to a fixed term in office, CrowdVote does something not unlike 
              what Social Media has done to traditional media: it gives everyone a voice, even if it's only a 
              re-tweet, +1, Pin or a Like, …all of which are functionally analogous, in the CrowdVote marketplace, 
              to inheriting a vote.
            </p>

            <p>
              People seeking to expand their influence in the community, like Jack above, will <strong>compete</strong> 
              for followers by voting and tagging decisions thoughtfully, perhaps in conjunction with blogging and 
              tweeting or otherwise promoting a reputation for expertise in the issues they care about. Lobbyists 
              will turn their attention to those members with the most followers at any given time. Nobody has to 
              wait until the next election to be heard. And all of this happens right out of the gate, because when 
              you first fire CrowdVote up and begin publishing decisions to be voted on, your constituents will all 
              effectively default to inheriting your vote, leaving you in a position of voting in accordance with 
              the wishes of people who are all just inheriting your vote…but who are all free now to cast their own 
              vote, or to follow someone else. They're not stuck with you until the next election!
            </p>

            <p>
              Now, CrowdVote won't be able to enforce being used in any particular way. If you run for office on 
              the pledge to CrowdVote all your decisions and then neglect to do so, or if your community decides 
              to use CrowdVote itself in lieu of electing representatives at all, CrowdVote has no way to follow 
              up on what happens after a decision's voting period closes. What CrowdVote <em>can</em> do, however, 
              is make all data completely transparent and easily queried and audited through a friendly REST-ful API. 
              Anyone can <em>re-run the numbers</em> anytime they like. And the calculation and tallying of every 
              ballot is easily delineated in verbose tally reports. Finally, CrowdVote also provides a mechanism 
              to verify everyone's membership in the community, while preserving the anonymity of the relationship 
              between their identity and their voting record, thereby allowing voters to remain anonymous, if they like.

                  What is a lobbyist? (… Or why are some members' votes not counted?)
                </h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  Community managers can optionally admit members whose votes are not counted. They can vote and their votes and how they tag decisions can be followed by other members. But their votes are not actually counted in the final tally. These are effectively lobbyists, who should be lobbying you instead of your representative.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                  In my old condo association, the nearby Audubon Society used to come by to do some public outreach and educate us on not using fertilizers and pesticides or how sensitive the Chesapeake watershed is. And it would've been so much easier if I could just have delegated my vote to them on decisions tagged "environmental".

                </h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  On your profile page, where you identify members you are following, the order in which they are listed is used to break any ties. So for instance, if the decision is whether to paint the community room red or blue, and you're following only two people: José and Elizabeth, and José voted red, and Elizabeth voted blue, then the choice of whomever is listed earlier among the people you're following breaks the tie.
