Management command to create a complex delegation test scenario.

This command creates a controlled test environment for validating CrowdVote's
delegation system, including vote averaging calculations, multi-level inheritance
chains, circular reference handling, and fractional vote inheritance.

The test scenario includes:
- 10 users (A-J) with specific naming patterns
- Complex following relationships using fruit-based tags
- Multi-level delegation chains (2-7 levels deep)
- Intentional circular references to test loop prevention
- Manual and calculated votes to verify fractional star averaging
